# SIS & Verilog Project

This is a Computer Architecture project I made in the academic year of 2023/2024 @ University of Verona. It was made with one my colleague who is mentioned in the Relazione.pdf file. 
It is about projecting and programming with SIS (a Synthesis Logic language) and Verilog (A Hardware Description Language) that is able to simulate and handle 
multiple "rock-paper-scissors" matches.
